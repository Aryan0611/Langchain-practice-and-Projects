ðŸ“Œ Repository Description

This repository contains my GenAI and LangChain practice projects, where I experiment with different concepts and build small applications to strengthen my understanding. It includes hands-on implementations of:

ðŸ§© Core Concepts Practice â€“ Trying out foundational ideas in Generative AI and LangChain.

ðŸŒŸ Celebrity Information (Parallel Sequencing) â€“ Using parallel chains to fetch and organize structured details.

ðŸ“– RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) â€“ Exploring how to combine LLMs with external knowledge bases.

âœ¨ Story Generator â€“ A creative project where the model generates engaging stories.

ðŸ”¬ Other Experiments â€“ Step-by-step practice with prompts, chains, memory, and integrations.

This repo is mainly for learning and experimenting, so code may be simple and exploratory. Iâ€™ll keep updating it as I learn more advanced GenAI and LangChain concepts. ðŸš€
